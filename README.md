# A simple Clock App

App reads file "file.conf".  
The first line of the file is a message displayed every second.  
The second line of the file is a message displayed every minute.  
The third line of the file is a message displayed every hour.  

Example file.conf content:
```
tic
tac
toe
```

The app will display 'tic' every second, 'tac' every minute, and 'toe' every hour.
